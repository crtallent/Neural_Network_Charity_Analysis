# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

For this project, we are working with Alphabet Soup, a non-profit organization that has raised and donated $10 billion over the last 20 years. They would like to analyze the impact of each of their donations, but sometimes the businesses that receive the funding disappear. Since Alphabet Soup's goal is to protect people's health and the environment, they would like to ensure that their contributions are making the impacts that will help them reach these goals. It is therefore necessary to determine if a neural network can help the company predict whether a donation should be made to an organization, and when the endeavor is too high-risk. Alphabet Soup has provided a dataset of over 34,000 donations that they have made, and the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/crtallent/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/charity_data.csv).
